					<h1 class="text-center">Washington DC</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>Team members Kobe and Matthias embarked on a journey to Washington DC this past August of 2017.</p>
					<p>The capitol, more so than anywhere else, houses the widest array of people in different professions, with different areas of expertise and––most importantly––who have different worldviews. We hope to use that intellectual and experiential capital to generate thought-provoking content in a broad range of subject matter. 
					</p><p>The conversations we have will be published as part of the inaugural iteration of The Common Thread Podcast: DC Series, which will familiarize the BU community with the inner workings and life of our nation’s capitol. We hope this will be the first of many Common Thread trips to DC, and that it will serve to strengthen the BU-DC connection.

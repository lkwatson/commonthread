					<h1 class="text-center">Washington DC</h1>
					<br/>
					<p>Team members Kobe and Matthias embarked on a journey to Washington DC this past August of 2017.</p>
					<p>The capitol, more so than anywhere else, houses the widest array of people in different professions, with different areas of expertise and––most importantly––who have different worldviews. We went in with hopes of generating thought-provoking, informative content that might, in some way, challenge the notion that there are black-and-white answers to the problems people in Washington are working on daily. 
					</p><p>The conversations we have are published as part of the inaugural iteration of The Common Thread Podcast: DC Series, which we hope will familiarize the BU community with the inner workings and life of our nation’s capitol. We hope this will be the first of many Common Thread trips to DC, and that it will serve to strengthen the BU-DC connection.
					</p><p>
  					Thank you to Pedro Falci and the people of the HTC, without which this series would not have happened.

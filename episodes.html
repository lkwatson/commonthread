              <p>
                Over 44 million people in the US have student debt, according to the Federal Reserve. The class of 2017 owes, on average, nearly $30,000 in student loans, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. This kind of debt can be a huge weight on young college graduates. So what can you do when student loans are the "new normal"?

              <p>
              Professor Emeritus Andrew Bacevich, a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf wars, has spent his academic career writing about American imperialism. He gave a well-regarded university lecture in 2007 about the "illusions of managing history," arguing for the contemporary relevance of 20th c. theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. In this episode we explore his career and intellectual evolution. He articulates a rather profound dissent to the employment of American military power, and discusses how Niebuhr's The Irony of American History impacted his worldview.

              <p>
              William McKeen is the a professor of journalism and author of 7 books, one of which includes "Outlaw Journalist," a biography of gonzo journalism maverick Hunter S. Thompson. McKeen helps paint the broader picture of Hunter S. Thompson from his childhood, the beginning of his career, into his later years. Here he discusses not just who Hunter S. Thompson was to the world, how he contributed to literature and journalism, but who Hunter Thompson was to himself. We try to make sense of Thompson’s story, a rebel and lifelong political dissident, a walking contradiction—gun-toting, America-loving, yet fiercely, wildly on the side of liberal reform in the 60s and 70s.

              <p>
              In the first part of our conversation with Brother Larry, University Chaplain for Community Life, we discussed the phenomenon of protestantization. Here we look at the case study of Confucianism that he addresses in his work. First, we take you through a crash course on the development of its ideas. Then, we talk about how protestantization may change the tradition. We also briefly address other religious traditions in the latter part of this discussion.

              <p>
              Lawrence Whitney, better known on campus as Brother Larry, is the University Chaplain for Community Life. His academic work is in comparative theology, focusing on Christianity and Confucianism. In this episode we discuss Protestantization, a phenomenon that affects non-native traditions within democratic-capitalist societies. This episode takes us through the historical development of Protestantism and Protestantization. Part II in the series will address the case study of Confucianism––first, we will look at its historical development in China and East Asia, then how it might change in a Protestant context.

              <p>
              Steven J. Mandile is an Iraq war veteran who was injured at the age of 27. He came home with Traumatic Brain Injury, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a spinal cord injury. He couldn't find help in the army medical system, and the Veterans Administration prescribed him 57 drugs over 5 years, including 9 opiates. He found his way out when he found cannabis, which allowed him to get off powerful opiates like fentanyl.
            </p><p>
              This is story of transformation. Listen to hear how Mr. Mandile became an activist, sleeping outside of the State House and rallying communities to support legal cannabis. He has founded Veterans Alternative Healing Inc. and is working to make sure veterans and communities of color have access to the legal market, and access to the business side of the industry as well.

              <p>
              What do we get for our foreign aid money? Even the cynic can admit that some part of our foreign aid is given to ease human suffering, but we also must consider the power foreign aid projects over the recipient nation states and how it advances US national interests. We sat down with Professor Henry Pascoe, an american professor at IE (Instituto Empresa) in Madrid, to discuss his work on how foreign aid works as an informal enforcement mechanism for international counterterrorism treaties. We look at the logic of states entering these agreements and the strategies recipient and donor states employ to get what they want out of these interactions.

          		<p>
              This discussion is the second segment of an episode with Professor Oscar Martinez-Tapia Nebrija University and IE [Instituto Empresa] in Madrid. Here we move from regional nationalisms in Spain to a broader look at how populism is shaping western democracies, and how habits of life are changing with modernization. The episode drifts nicely from how the central Spanish government is dealing with Catalonia into a broad social commentary that sums up our time with professor Martinez-Tapia. Our thanks to him for his time.

              We sit down with Professor Oscar Martinez-Tapia of Nebrija University and IE [Instituto Empresa] in Madrid to discuss his work on political party formation in two of Spain's autonomous regions––Basque Country, also referred to as País Vasco in the episode, and Catalunya.  The discussion, geared towards American listeners, will trace the history of the nationalist sentiment and political party formation, then turn to the current strategies of nationalist politicians. It will look comparatively at the two cases. This is the first segment of our discussion with Professor Martinez, the latter of which will be published separately and look at populism in Spain more broadly.

              After working with Professor Hutch Hutchinson during BU Orientation this summer, Kobe and Erin sat down with him to dig deep into experiential education. The Common Ground program, in which new students use GPS mapping to explore the city, visit historical sites, and get to know each other, is built upon these principles. Although one of the key components of experiential education is outdoor education, principles from summer camp, high ropes courses, backpacking trips, and outdoor teambuilding retreats are applicable in all settings, for all groups of people.

              Team members Erin and Patrick met Diane Gallagher, the Nursing Archivist at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. We learned that not only did she serve in the Peace Corps in Cape Verde when she was 53, but won the Lillian Carter Award from President Jimmy Carter and has met with Michelle Obama.
    					</p><p>
      					 Her book, Lure of Service (now on the shelves of the Howard Thurman Center), is an entertaining memoir of her time in Cape Verde - the projects she worked on, who she loved, and what she learned from the Cape Verdeans. A New York City native, Diane now is a host mother for Harvard's international student program and continues to be involved with the Peace Corps. We sat down and chatted about her beliefs on whining, grit, learning about other cultures, caring for people, humility, and what BU means when it says we need to be global citizens. We hope you enjoy her insight and jaw-dropping stories as much as we did.​

							<p>
							Boston Confucianism, which argues for the applicability of Confucian values globally, rather than just in East Asia, is an intellectual movement pioneered by Dr. Robert Neville (former Dean of Marsh Chapel and the School of Theology; currently a professor of Philosophy, Religion and Theology at BU). Here, we discuss the inception of Boston Confucianism and the many potential points of contact between Confucianism and the west.

							<p>
							The Republican Party is now in power across our federal government, holds the majority of governorships and of state legislative bodies. Yet, in the wake of President Trump's rise and all the coverage of his personality and character, it can seem like we're still an election season rather than a season of governance. We wanted to drive to the root of substantive issues so we spoke with Corey Pray, President of BU College Republicans, and Anastasia Koartes, Secretary of BU College Republicans. This discussion covers a lot of ground, from the diversity of conservative thought, Republican methods of appealing to millennials, foreign policy, and other prevalent issues.

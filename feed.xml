            <title>Martin Luther King - His Last Years</title>
            <description>Martin Luther King Jr. is tragically misrepresented as a simple idealist who offered moving oratory. In truth, he was much more than this. He was a revolutionary leader who evolved to face the challenges posed to his movement and offered radical proposals to solve the plight of the poor. Listen to us discuss the final years of his life based on extensive research and conversations with Reverend Julian Cook and Mr. Ryan Hendrickson.</description>

            <title>BU College Republicans</title>
            <description>The Republican Party is now in power across our federal government, holds the majority of governorships and of state legislative bodies. Yet, in the wake of President Trump's rise and all the coverage of his personality and character, it can seem like we're still an election season rather than a season of governance. We wanted to drive to the root of substantive issues so we spoke with Corey Pray, President of BU College Republicans, and Anastasia Koartes, Secretary of BU College Republicans. This discussion covers a lot of ground, from the diversity of conservative thought, Republican methods of appealing to millennials, foreign policy, and other prevalent issues.</description>

            <description>This episode features a conversation with recent Boston University graduate Maya Gazhal, who shares his experiences and perspectives about spending a summer in Palestine as an activist, teacher and IT guy. Given how controversial and charged the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, we approached this episode with the intent of understanding why one of our peers would go to Palestine and what he observed while he was there. We hope you find it interesting, as we did.

            <description>Recently, the Climate Leadership Council brought together some prominent establishment conservatives––including several former cabinet officials––to release a novel plan to combat climate change: "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends". This prompted us to sit down with James Baldwin, a lecturer in the Earth and Environment Department at Boston University. We discuss his ongoing research, explore the range of possible outcomes for the species and analyze this plan in its political context.</description>

            <title>Chicago's History Episode 1: MLK and Civil Rights</title>
            <description>Chicago has come up frequently in the national political conversation, mostly to serve as a negative example for everything that’s wrong with the country and society today. Matthias sat down with Reverend Julian Cook for the first episode of a series on Chicago’s history from 1966 to present day. This episode focuses on the social conditions that motivated MLK JR to take the Civil Rights movement to Chicago, the turbulence of the sixties, and Chicago as an economic hub amongst other things. We hope the conversations will provide some insight into the spirit of the city, its challenges, its aspirations and the historical dynamics that made the city what it is today.</description>

            <title>Peace Corps Adventures at Middle Age</title>
            <description>Team members Erin and Patrick met Diane Gallagher, the Nursing Archivist at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. We learned that not only did she serve in the Peace Corps in Cape Verde when she was 53, but won the Lillian Carter Award from President Jimmy Carter and has met with Michelle Obama. Her book, Lure of Service (now on the shelves of the Howard Thurman Center), is an entertaining memoir of her time in Cape Verde - the projects she worked on, who she loved, and what she learned from the Cape Verdeans. A New York City native, Diane now is a host mother for Harvard's international student program and continues to be involved with the Peace Corps. We sat down and chatted about her beliefs on whining, grit, learning about other cultures, caring for people, humility, and what BU means when it says we need to be global citizens. We hope you enjoy her insight and jaw-dropping stories as much as we did.​</description>

            <title>Experiential Education Part 1</title>
            <description>After working with Professor Hutch Hutchinson during BU Orientation this summer, Kobe and Erin sat down with him to dig deep into experiential education. The Common Ground program, in which new students use GPS mapping to explore the city, visit historical sites, and get to know each other, is built upon these principles. Although one of the key components of experiential education is outdoor education, principles from summer camp, high ropes courses, backpacking trips, and outdoor teambuilding retreats are applicable in all settings, for all groups of people.

            <description>See background information at www.commonthreadpodcast.com/washington-dc. Adrian Atizado is a veteran of the Persian Gulf War. He has spent the last 17 years working for Disabled American Veterans, a veterans service organization (VSO) dedicated to advocating for veterans injured during their service. After recounting his path to his current position––Deputy National Legislative Director––he helps us deconstruct the history and role of VSOs in Washington DC, dating back to the First World War. He then helps us understand in more specific terms some of the legislative fixes he sees as necessary to making the system work better for our former service members. We also address Gulf War Illness, a difficult-to-diagnose condition observed in veterans of that war that is often difficult to claim benefits for.

            <description>We sit down with Professor Oscar Martinez-Tapia of Nebrija University and IE [Instituto Empresa] in Madrid to discuss his work on political party formation in two of Spain's autonomous regions––Basque Country, also referred to as País Vasco in the episode, and Catalunya.  The discussion, geared towards American listeners, will trace the history of the nationalist sentiment and political party formation, then turn to the current strategies of nationalist politicians. It will look comparatively at the two cases. This is the first segment of our discussion with Professor Martinez, the latter of which will be published separately and look at populism in Spain more broadly.

            <description>Legal cannabis is soon to come to Massachusetts, but ensuring the launch goes well is key to its success. We sat down with Dr. Marion McNabb (SPH '17) who started the Cannabis Community Care and Research Network (C3RN) to advocate on Beacon Hill and in municipalities around the state. We discuss her work, social disparities, research licenses, small cannabis businesses. opioid treatment and more. 
            Her organization is hosting an event at Roxbury Community College on Monday February 26th which she calls a "job skills fair for cannabis." It is that and more: there will be experts covering all aspects of the issue. To find out more information about the event and how to go email Joe Gilmore of Students for Sensible Drug Policy at joe[at]massreccouncil.com. We will follow up on the event when we speak with Mr. Gilmore in March. This event focuses on the social disparities aspect, and the April event (if you miss the first) will focus on opioid addiction treatment.

            <description>What do we get for our foreign aid money? Even the cynic can admit that some part of our foreign aid is given to ease human suffering, but we also must consider the power foreign aid projects over the recipient nation states and how it advances US national interests. We sat down with Professor Henry Pascoe, an american professor at IE (Instituto Empresa) in Madrid, to discuss his work on how foreign aid works as an informal enforcement mechanism for international counterterrorism treaties. We look at the logic of states entering these agreements and the strategies recipient and donor states employ to get what they want out of these interactions.

        <title>A Veteran's Transformation: The Story of Steven J. Mandile</title>
            <description>Steven J. Mandile is an Iraq war veteran who was injured at the age of 27. He came home with Traumatic Brain Injury, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and a spinal cord injury. He couldn't find help in the army medical system, and the Veterans Administration prescribed him 57 drugs over 5 years, including 9 opiates. He found his way out when he found cannabis, which allowed him to get off powerful opiates like fentanyl.

            This is story of transformation. Listen to hear how Mr. Mandile became an activist, sleeping outside of the State House and rallying communities to support legal cannabis. He has founded Veterans Alternative Healing Inc. and is working to make sure veterans and communities of color have access to the legal market, and access to the business side of the industry as well.

            Please see his organization's website: https://vahinc.org/services

        <title>Brother Larry Part 1: Protestantization</title>
            <description>Lawrence Whitney, better known on campus as Brother Larry, is the University Chaplain for Community Life. His academic work is in comparative theology, focusing on Christianity and Confucianism. 
                In this episode we discuss Protestantization, a phenomenon that affects non-native traditions within democratic-capitalist societies. This episode takes us through the historical development of Protestantism and Protestantization. Part II in the series will address the case study of Confucianism––first, we will look at its historical development in China and East Asia, then how it might change in a Protestant context. 
                We would like to extend our thanks to Brother Larry for generously spending time with us discussing his work.

        <title>William McKeen on Hunter S. Thompson</title>
            <description>William McKeen is the a professor of journalism and author of 7 books, one of which includes "Outlaw Journalist," a biography of gonzo journalism maverick Hunter S. Thompson. McKeen helps paint the broader picture of Hunter S. Thompson from his childhood, the beginning of his career, into his later years. Here he discusses not just who Hunter S. Thompson was to the world, how he contributed to literature and journalism, but who Hunter Thompson was to himself. We try to make sense of Thompson’s story, a rebel and lifelong political dissident, a walking contradiction—gun-toting, America-loving, yet fiercely, wildly on the side of liberal reform in the 60s and 70s.

        <title>Dr. Bacevich and the Niebuhrian Critique of American Power</title>
            <description>Professor Emeritus Andrew Bacevich, a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf wars, has spent his academic career writing about American imperialism. He gave a well-regarded university lecture in 2007 about the "illusions of managing history," arguing for the contemporary relevance of 20th c. theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. In this episode we explore his career and intellectual evolution. He articulates a rather profound dissent to the employment of American military power, and discusses how Niebuhr's The Irony of American History impacted his worldview.

            Dr. Bacevich is also the author of works such as Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country and America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History, among others. In this interview we heavily reference a work he edited and contributed an article to, The Long War. We are very grateful to Dr. Bacevich for his time.

            For a further exploration of Reinhold Niebuhr see our episode with Rev. Julian Cook. If you are interested in having conversations like these you can find out about applying at bu.edu/htc and finding Common Thread under the programs tab.

            <description>Over 44 million people in the US have student debt, according to the Federal Reserve. The class of 2017 owes, on average, nearly $30,000 in student loans, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. This kind of debt can be a huge weight on young college graduates. So what can you do when student loans are the "new normal"? Grace and Erica sat down with Bob Hildreth, founder of the Hildreth Institute, a new nonprofit fighting for debt-free college. He shared his knowledge about the student debt crisis and what could help to end it.
